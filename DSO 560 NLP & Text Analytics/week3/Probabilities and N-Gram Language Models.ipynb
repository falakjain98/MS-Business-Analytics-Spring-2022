    "- the larger the dataset, and by implication, the more rich the corpus, the larger the n we can likely try.\n",
    "- in practice, $n = 2$, $n = 3$, $n = 4$ work well. A larger $n$ tends to begin to overfit (and may be computationally extremely expensive). Remember the **bias-variance** tradeoff (http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html):\n",

    "Here, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, model complexity increases dramatically.\n",
