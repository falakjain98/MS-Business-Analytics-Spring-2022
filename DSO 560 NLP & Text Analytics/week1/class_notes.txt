Basic Python Expressions for Working with Text.ipynb
- Scale of data
- Each unit of data is 1000 times the previous unit
- Use open method to open text files
- file.readline() reads one line at a time (up till new line character)
- pd.read_csv() reads entire file, which can lead to memory error, therefore .readline() preferred
- file.seek(0) seeks back to the first line of the document
- word count can be done using dictionary at a basic level
- splitting on whitespace returns double white spaces in care there are any
- splitting on whitespaces in an empty string returns an empty string
- use assert for sanity checks, can prevent need of debugging
- using Counter is a much easier way to count words, has useful methods in built as well
- use double tab for available methods to a function
- in most docs, word distribution is highly highly right skewed, with most words occuring a handful of times only
- ith most common word appears 0.1/i^alpha times with alpha = 1
- too frequent and too rare words do not add value to ML model
